# Academy
 
This project was created for university course. The project has 3 roles, Admin, Teacher User. 
Admin role can give teacher rights and also can get then back. He can monitors all courses for compliance with the rules, he can either remove or edit the courses.
Teacher role can create new courses, as much, as he want. He can see only his created courses.
User role, can not do anithing, except watch all the courses.



In the future I will make a form for applying for a teacher. When the user chooses a lesson, 
he will have to pay some amount to the teacher, of this amount some percentage will be for the platform. 
The user (student) will have a "Courses" section, where all the courses he has purchased will be saved.
